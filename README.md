## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Component framework

### What I learned

This is the second project where I've been using vanilla CSS exclusively and experimenting with custom properties.
I feel like I'm getting a lot more comfortable with CSS and I'm really starting to think about all the possible use-cases for custom properties.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue exploring and getting more comfortable with Svelte and vanilla CSS. I definitely picked up some ideas working on this project that I'd like to implement in the next one - mostly having to do with custom properties and code organization.
